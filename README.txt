Changes Made to Klondike Pt 1.
1. simplified deck creation: changed the initDeck() method to be a simplified for loop
   with less repetitive code
2. created rank and suit enumerations and added to CardBuilder rather than just using strings
3. removed unused/useless drawCard() method from BasicKlondike
4. made any methods in BasicKlondike that weren't in the interface private


NOTE:
Cascade piles are printed in a manner so that it is rotated 90ยบ counter-clockwise and flipped
vertically. My apologies. (FIXED)


Changes Made to Klondike Pt 2.
1. made helper methods for the controller for any repeated code (i.e. throwing exceptions,
   common error messages, appending a new line)
2. deleted a basic klondike constructor that was never used (took in a deck ??)
3. fixed the printing of my cascade piles so that they are printed in the correct orientation
   (but with slightly incorrect spacing)
4. added more tests to PrivateModelTests to test the controller more
